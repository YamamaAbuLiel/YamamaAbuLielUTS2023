First i want to thank you for the orginaized work, it shows how much you cares and want to learn.

Task 1 :
the rectangle bellow ISCOSOFT was supposed to be title for the text, only showing when hover over the text,
however you did much harder job.
Excellent.
4/4



Task 2 :
My only note is Tables and last Div are overstreched, 
you had the right idea but the wrong value, change width to 50% to fix that
Otherwise Great Work
3/4

Task 3 : 
Turning Pink when mobile didnt work on my device.
after reviewing the code,
@media tag can be standalone,
so you can have it like this
 @media screen and (max-width:700px) {
            body{
                  background-color: pink;
            }
     }
also you need this line
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Everything Else Perfect.
3/4

Task 4 :
Perfect
Nicly Done
Responsive not working because of the missing <meta> tag i mentioned in the previous task
Good job.
4/4

Task 5 :
Nice thinking with seperating the script
the task required a photo intilized when loading the page,
you can fix that buy multiple ways, one of them is making the following <body onload="WebSite(0)">
this will call the function when page loads thus initilizing with image,
you werent supposed to change the button label, we dont do that unless the functionalty changed
i guess you understood the task wrong, dont worry not a big deal.
Good Job.

Although you didint make Dinnermite, Otaku Hub is a great way to show your skills, 
Soon we will be going back to dinnermite, so we complete the site in react,
Good Job.
4/4

Task 17 :
Let me help you a bit with react.
from the name, ReactJS
java script is the base of this library,
we use react to create single page applications.
so the website we create only renders one page.
and using js we create the page and all its content
we can create a project and run it on local host,
or we can insert cdns to the page
cdns are links, avalible online to create almost everything
in this page we needed to add these cdns, you added them
now, because every thing is in js
every page we want to create, is a class
classes have constructers which will be our initilized varibles
inside this constructer, we create this.state object.
this object is the base of our work.
everything that changes is the state of the page, when it changes, we update the state using setState()
when the state changes, the page reloads whatever part its state changed
which makes the page super fast.
every js class have a render() function
this function have return
whatever you return will be displayed on the page
html, pure text, or even components,
components are other js classes
so for your work just do the following
 <script type="text/babel">

        class MyComponent extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render(){
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Isra Software & Computer Co.</h1>
    <p>Isra Software and Computer Company was established in 1997 in Nablus as a specialized in the production of software at Palestine and Arab Countries.</p>
    <p> Includes more than 50 employees distributed in the following in the main department (Research and Development , Training and Operation,Marketing and Sales , Finance, Audit and Quality).</p>
    <p>In addition to the company's headquarters in the city of Nablus , The company's branch was opened in Ramallah in 2004 to serve and flow-up customers in the central and southern regions.</p>
    {//insert the table here
}
            </div>
        );
      }
    }
      ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('mydiv'))

    </script>

2/4

Task 18 :

on the function side, you forgot to add app.js, which seems to contain the handler
so i cant test the functionlty you created.
