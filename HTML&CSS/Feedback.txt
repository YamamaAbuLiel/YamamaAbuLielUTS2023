First i want to thank you for the orginaized work, it shows how much you cares and want to learn.

Task 1 :
the rectangle bellow ISCOSOFT was supposed to be title for the text, only showing when hover over the text,
however you did much harder job.
Excellent.

Task 2 :
My only note is Tables and last Div are overstreched, 
you had the right idea but the wrong value, change width to 50% to fix that
Otherwise Great Work

Task 3 : 
Turning Pink when mobile didnt work on my device.
after reviewing the code,
@media tag can be standalone,
so you can have it like this
 @media screen and (max-width:700px) {
            body{
                  background-color: pink;
            }
     }
also you need this line
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Everything Else Perfect.

Task 4 :
Perfect
Nicly Done
Responsive not working because of the missing <meta> tag i mentioned in the previous task
Good job.
